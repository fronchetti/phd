There are a plenty of tools we can combine to program robots. In this file, I highlight some tools that are relevant and/or interesting to use in robotics.
Not all of them are strictly related to robots, but some could be used on them.

## ▶️ Game Development
- [Unity Gaming Engine](https://unity.com/) - Mainly used to implement interactive 3D environments that could be used in combination with other toolkits.


## ▶️ Mixed Reality
- [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/) - Used to implement mixed reality applications on Hololens, Oculus, etc.
