In this repository I highlight relevant theoretical and practical knowledge I acquired from my Ph.D. in Computer Science. My goal is to use this repository as a personal notebook where I can list technologies that I have used, references that I read, and studies that I have conducted throughout my years in the United States. Others might also find the information contained in this repository useful for their work, and for this reason, I make it public. 

**Disclaimer:** The information available in this repository should not be interpreted as a tutorial, guideline, or best reference for your problem. It is purely based on my  personal experience as a researcher. Better options and opinions may exist out there, so please create your own perspectives.
