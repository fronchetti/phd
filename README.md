![Title](https://github.com/fronchetti/phd/blob/main/readme_title.png?raw=true)

In this repository I highlight relevant theoretical and practical knowledge I acquired in my PhD. in Computer Science. My goal is to use this repository as a personal notebook where I can list technologies that I have used, references that I read, and studies that I have conducted throughout my years in the United States. Others might also find the information contained in this repository useful for their work, and for this reason, I make it public.
